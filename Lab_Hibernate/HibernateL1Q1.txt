Question 1: What is SessionFactory in hibernate? Explain with example?
Ans ->
Hibernate, the SessionFactory is a central and important component that provides a factory for creating Session objects.
 A Session represents a single unit of work and acts as a gateway to interact with the database. The SessionFactory is responsible for managing the connection to
 the database, maintaining the mapping between Java objects and database tables, and handling the caching of objects for better performance.

 example:-
@Entity
@Table(name = "employees")
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "id")
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "name")
    private String name;

    @Column(name = "salary")
    private double salary;

  }

Configuration configuration = new Configuration().configure("hibernate.cfg.xml");
SessionFactory sessionFactory = configuration.buildSessionFactory();

Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction();

Employee employee = new Employee();
employee.setName("John Doe");
employee.setSalary(50000.0);

session.save(employee);

transaction.commit();
session.close();
